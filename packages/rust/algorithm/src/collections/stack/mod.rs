/// A stack-like data structure implemented through a `Vec`.
///
/// The name "stack" for this type of structure comes from the analogy to a set
/// of physical items stacked on top of each other, which makes it easy to take
/// an item off the top of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the
/// stack may require taking off multiple other items first.
///
/// Considered as a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential
/// collection, the push and pop operations occur only at one end of the
/// structure, referred to as the top of the stack.
