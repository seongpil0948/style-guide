# best_perormance-cpp

basic

- cpp file in which it is used.
    When you compile a program, each .cpp file
    is compiled independently into a compilation unit

- The compiler has no knowledge
    of what names are declared in other compilation units
    That means that if you define a class or function or global variable,
    you must provide a declaration of that thing in each
    additional .cpp file that uses it
